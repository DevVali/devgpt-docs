# âš™ Installation

**Attention:** We are currently in the process of preparing for our launch, scheduled for today, **August 1, 2023.** Please revisit our documentation shortly to access the installation instructions for DevGPT. Kindly note that Version 1-1-0 necessitates a local application to be operational. Although we are in the process of uploading it to homebrew, it may take a few hours. We appreciate your patience and encourage you to check back later for the latest updates.



Thank you! - Team Feb
