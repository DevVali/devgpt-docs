## How does she work?

Introducing Avery-1, an invaluable tool that offers a range of features to streamline developer tasks. By simply providing a few API keys, Avery-1 efficiently breaks down complex assignments into manageable subtasks. Leveraging publicly available code generation models, it automatically generates high-quality code for each task.

The end result? A seamless workflow that saves developers precious time and effort. Furthermore, Avery-1 goes the extra mile by raising the meticulously crafted work as a professional Pull Request on GitHub. But the story doesn't end there. We're excited to announce that we're currently hard at work on Avery-2, an open-source iteration of Avery-1, aiming to empower and revolutionise the developer community with enhanced capabilities.

Stay tuned for the future of efficient coding!
