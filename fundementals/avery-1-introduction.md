# ðŸ“ª DevGPT Introduction

## What is DevGPT?

DevGPT enables autonomous code generation, DevGPT accepts a prompt and writes code directly to your IDE based on that prompt.



The end result? A seamless workflow that saves developers precious time and effort. But the story doesn't end there. We're excited to announce that we're currently hard at an open-source iteration of DevGPT, aiming to empower and revolutionise the developer community with enhanced capabilities.

Stay tuned for the future of efficient coding!
