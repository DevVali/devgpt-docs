# ðŸ“Ž Understanding Limitations

Avery-1 is a powerful tool designed to streamline developer tasks, but it does have some limitations.

### **Limitations of Avery-1:**

* API Key Requirement: Users are required to provide their API keys, which may raise security and privacy concerns, this makes Avery-1 not very Enterprise friendly.
* Dependence on Code Generation Models: Avery-1 relies on publicly available code generation models, which limits the range of code it can produce.
* Compatibility with Project Requirements: The generated code may not always meet specific project requirements or adhere to certain coding standards.
* Task Breakdown Complexity: Avery-1's ability to accurately break down tasks into subtasks may vary depending on the complexity of the project.
* Occasional Bugs and Technical Issues: Like any tool, Avery-1 is subject to occasional bugs or technical issues that can impact its performance.
* Continuous Improvement: The community is actively working on addressing these limitations in future versions like Avery-2, an open-source evolution of the tool.
