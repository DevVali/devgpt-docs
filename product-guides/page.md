We're happy that you're interested in trying out DevGPT. To get started, please [refer to this website](https://code.devgpt.com) and follow along with the quick-start tutorial.

## Authenticating

Choose your favorite git provider and sign in. We are currently GitHub exclusive, but not for long! We'll be releasing integrations for BitBucket and GitLab soon.

## Select your repository

Once you're signed in, a modal with the list of your repositores will pop up. Select one of your repositories so that DevGPT can set up the workspace for you.
