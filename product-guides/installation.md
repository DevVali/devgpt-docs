> Note: Our Windows version is currently un-notarised, meaning you will get a message during installation saying that it is from an unverified developer. We will have a notarised version soon. Our Apple version is already notarised, but the Windows process is taking slightly longer.

If you have any questions, get in touch with our team on Discord. We are excited to hear what you create!
